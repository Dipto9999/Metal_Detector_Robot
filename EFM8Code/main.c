// The purpose of this file is to begin programming 
// the EFM8 board who's job is too control the motors 
// and read the distance from a metal object using the given circuit
// It then must relay this information to the remote via a JDY40
// It must also recieve information from the JDY40 to decide the direction 
// and speed it must move, this will be done controlling the motors 
// For this we will need ADC as well as PWM pins 
// We will also need to recieve information from the JDY40 via states
